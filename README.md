# 80s Engineering - Open Source OBC v2.0

This repository contains the open source firmware for **80s Engineering's On-Board Computer (OBC) v2.0**, which is a modern take on the original on-board computer found in premium BMWs
of the late 80s. 

It replicates most of the original functions and adds performance-oriented features, while maintaining its retro aesthetics.

The firmware is written in **MicroPython** and runs on a **Raspberry Pi Pico W**. 

This project is also a great base for **custom applications**, as the device offers multiple accessible **Input/Output Digital/Analog pins** for sensors, switches, or other hardware extensions.

It's mainly for this matter that this firmware is open-sourced.

## üìÅ File Structure

| File         | Description                                                                 |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `main.py`    | Main program. Core logic of the OBC. Handles system's functions (menu navigation, on/off...), application functions (hour, laptimer, oil pressure...), and setting functions.|
| `FOTA directory`  |Backend of the Firmware-Over-The-Air (wireless update) system|
| `buttons.py` | Handles press/long-press button detection, and debouncing|
| `dictionnary.py` |Stores all the displayed words and translations          |
| `fota-master.py`|Wireless update handler|
| `GPS_parser.py`| Parses GPS data               |
| `hardware_tester.py`   |Used to test components after board assembly|
| `ht16k33_driver.py`   |Display driver|
| `imu.py`   |Accelerometer driver|
| `injector_pulse_analyzer.py`   |Wild shit to analyze frequency and width of injector pulses|
| `logging.py`   |Used to log events for debug purposes|
| `mcp3208.py`   |Analog-to-digital converter driver|
| `memory.py`   |Used to get and set data in the non-volatile memory of the RPi|
| `temperatuy.py`   |Driver for oil/out/water/exhaust temperature sensors|
| `timer.py`   |Timer and laptimer handler|
| `unit.py`   |Handles the mess of imperial units|
| `vector3d.py`   |Dependency for the imu driver. Probably useless|

## üîß Modify or Extend the Firmware

If you'd like to customize the OBC with new features, integrations, or improvements:

- feel free to reach me out at üìß **contact@80s.engineering**.
- you can reprogram the OBC's board using Thonny IDE and a microUSB connected to the Raspberry Pi Pico W.
- I can release your changes so that you can wirelessly update them on your unit. 

I'd be happy to review your changes and merge improvements into the official release.
